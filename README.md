# gog-proxy

Proxy arround some GOG endpoints for extending API capabilities for better Linux support.

## The target

This project aims to close the gap between features offered for each platform. Starting with cloud saves.

We hope GOG will eventually provide that data themselves, untill then we are on our own.

## Contributing

The `games_data/` directory contains `ClientId.json` files for each game. Contributions to that directory are welcome. All json files are formatted using Prettier
